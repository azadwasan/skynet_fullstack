# skynet

Skynet is full-stack solution to serve as a generic platform to design application that facilitate service provider and service consumer interaction, such as, Fiverr and Food panda.

Skynet has the following major components

* Front-Ends
  1. Service Provider
      Service provider allows the merchants/freelancers (or some other role depending on the concrete application) to register with the Skynet service and add the services/goods that they are going to offer.
      This is being develped in React.js.
      
  2. Service consumer
      Service consumers are the users that will buy/rent/hire the services offered by service providers.
      This is being develped in React.js.

  3. Admin Dashboard
      This is the admin dashboard for the entity running the speicifc application. Using admin dashboard, one can approve service, address complains, manage billing etc.
      This is being develped in React.js.

* Backend
    The backend consists of MySQL database. The backend server has been implemented in Express.js

Current Repository: This specific repository is the backend of the Skynet platform. It was initially developed in my own company's account "amzpak". It has now been forked into my personal account and from now on the development of both front-ends and the backends will continue on my personal GitHub account.
